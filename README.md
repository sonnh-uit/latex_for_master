# latex for master

## Motivation

During their studies, graduate students often have to do a lot of homework and research. In addition to specialized conferences that require forms, UIT 's lecturer often do not require uniform reporting forms. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage.

The advantage is that students can freely use tools and forms that they are familiar with. Some students have the ability to draft the same forms that are inherited over many periods of study and reporting.

However, study master must make us will become expert. It required high research skills and therefore, there are many rules that need to be followed. The lack of an official form but only a few general rules causes difficulties in the submission process because each student uses different fonts, line spacing, and letter sizes.

During my studies, I met and interacted with visiting lecturers at other schools teaching UIT. After contacting the management unit, he was surprised that UIT itself did not have a unified form for reports for such needs. This motivated me even more to write a form specifically for UIT.

This form is written in Latex, a common language that in many cases is mandatory. Other students can easily access and use it. The sections mentioned in the syllabus are for reference only, depending on the subject and the lecturer may request additional sections, but this does not affect the full text format of the syllabus.

## How to use

This repositoy has proposal with both VN and EN. You can use `vn_proposla.tex` for Vietnames and `en_proposal.tex` for EN. Each section will located in `proposal` folder.
